# California Housing Price Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting housing prices in California using traditional machine learning models. The project aims to analyze the California housing dataset and build models to accurately predict housing prices based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the California Housing dataset, which contains information about housing prices in various locations in California. The dataset includes features such as the average number of rooms, median income, population, and proximity to the ocean.

## Models

Several traditional machine learning models are implemented in this project for housing price prediction, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
- Support Vector Regression

Each model is trained and evaluated using appropriate techniques, and the best-performing model is selected for final predictions.

## Usage

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and run it open it with jupyter lab or notebook
